# Final Project

## Description

You will build a project of your own design that utilizes all the concepts you learned in this course. You should design a portfolio project that showcases your ability to build an app that utilizes GraphQL, Node, React, and Apollo.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you should be able toâ€¦

1. Build an app of your own design that utilizes GraphQL, Node, React, and Apollo
    
## Requirements
List out requirements for the project here

1. Project must use GraphQL, Node, React, and Apollo
    1. If you wish to use something other than Node, React, and Apollo, it must require instructor approval
1. Your app must consist of at least 3 types
1. There must be at least 1 relationship (i.e. one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.) between the types
1. You must utilize an external API (not the OpenWeather API)
